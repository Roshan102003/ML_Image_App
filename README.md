# Machine Learning Model: "Rep Counting ML Model" using Image detection.

Welcome to the "Rep counting Machine Learning Model" open source project!

Are you tired of manually counting reps at the gym? Do you want to optimize your workouts and track your progress more accurately? Look no further! Our project uses machine learning to automatically count reps in real-time from a video stream.

Using computer vision techniques, our model is able to detect and classify different types of exercises, such as bicep curls, tricep dips, and pushups. With the help of our model, you can easily track your rep count, set goals, and analyze your performance over time.

Not only is this tool useful for fitness enthusiasts, it has numerous applications in the field of physical therapy, sports training, and even rehabilitation. Imagine being able to customize a workout routine for a patient based on their progress and needs, all with the help of automated rep counting.

Our project is built with Python, using popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow & Mediapipeline etc. We also make use of modern web technologies to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.

We welcome contributions from the open source community! Whether you are a machine learning expert or just starting out, there are many ways to get involved. You can help improve the model's accuracy, add new features, or work on the user interface.

Join us on this exciting journey to revolutionize the way we track and analyze our workouts. Together, we can make fitness more accessible and effective for everyone.
